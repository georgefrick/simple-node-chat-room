===========
### Basic example of using net library in node.js

This module offers a simple example where users can connect (telnet/etc) and communicate with each other.

This is a very basic example and handles no protocols or otherwise necessary details; it's meant to show the usage of creating a listening socket for someone who just wants a raw example.

Running
------------

Install with `node`:

``` bash
$ node chat
```
